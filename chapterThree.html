             <p>     Businesses today face a fast-changing, global environment that demands rapid software
                     development to seize opportunities and stay competitive. Because requirements often 
                     change unpredictably, traditional plan-driven models like the waterfall approach are 
                     too rigid, leading to delays and outdated systems. While such models may still suit 
                     safety-critical systems, business software needs flexible, rapid development processes 
                     that adapt to evolving requirements. This need led to incremental development in the 1980s
                     and gained momentum in the late 1990s with the rise of agile methodologies such as DSDM, 
                     Scrum, and Extreme Programming.<br><br>

                     Rapid software development processes are designed to produce useful software quickly.
                    The software is not developed as a single unit but as a series of increments,with each
                    increment including new system functionality. Although there are manyapproaches to rapid
                    software development, they share some fundamental characteristics:<br><br></p>

                <ol>
                    <li> The processes of specification, design, and implementation are interleaved.
                         There is no detailed system specification, and design documentation is mini
                         mized or generated automatically by the programming environment used to
                         implement the system. The user requirements document only defines the most
                         important characteristics of the system.<br><br></li>
                    <li> The system is developed in a series of versions. End-users and other system
                        stakeholders are involved in specifying and evaluating each version. They may
                        propose changes to the software and new requirements that should be imple
                        mented in a later version of the system.<br><br></li>
                    <li>System user interfaces are often developed using an interactive development
                        system that allows the interface design to be quickly created by drawing and placing
                        icons on the interface. The system may then generate a web-based interface for 
                        a browser or an interface for a specific platform such as Microsoft Windows.<br><br></li>
                </ol>

                <p> Agile methods are incremental development methods in which the increments are
                    small and, typically, new releases of the system are created and made available to cus
                    tomers every two or three weeks. They involve customers in the development process
                    to get rapid feedback on changing requirements. They minimize documentation by
                    using informal communications rather than formal meetings with written documents.<br><br></p>

                    <hr>
                <p > In the 1980s and early 1990s, software engineering
                     emphasized plan-driven, heavyweight methods involving detailed planning, documentation, quality assurance, 
                     and formal design tools, which suited large, long-lived,
                    safety-critical systems like aerospace and government projects.<br> <br>
                    These projects required coordination among large, distributed teams and justified the overhead of rigorous
                    processes.<br>
                    However, when applied to <b>smaller business systems</b>, the bureaucracy became excessive, with more effort<br>
                    spent on planning and documentation than coding and testing. <br><br>
                    This inefficiency, coupled with the need to adapt to rapidly changing requirements, led to the rise of agile
                    methods in the 1990s. Agile approaches shifted focus to <b>incremental development, quick delivery of working software, customer
                    feedback, and minimal documentation</b>, making them more effective for dynamic application development.<br><br>
                    
                    The philosophy behind agile methods is reflected in the agile manifesto that was
                    agreed on by many of the leading developers of these methods.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p> This manifesto states:<br><br>
                    
                    We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.<br>
                    Through this work we have come to value:<br></p>

                    <p> <i>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br><br>

                        Working software over comprehensive documentation<br><br>

                        Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br><br>

                        Responding to change over following a plan<br><br></i>
                    
                     That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the<br>
                     left more.<br><br>
                    
                     Probably the best-known agile method is extreme programming (Beck, 1999;
                     Beck, 2000), which I describe later in this chapter. Other agile approaches include
                     Scrum (Cohn, 2009; Schwaber, 2004; Schwaber and Beedle, 2001), Crystal
                     (Cockburn, 2001; Cockburn, 2004), Adaptive Software Development (Highsmith,
                     2000), DSDM (Stapleton, 1997; Stapleton, 2003), and Feature Driven Development
                     (Palmer and Felsing, 2002). The success of these methods has led to some integration
                     with more traditional development methods based on system modelling, resulting in
                     the notion of agile modelling (Ambler and Jeffries, 2002) and agile instantiations of
                     the Rational Unified Process (Larman, 2002).<br><br>
                      Although these agile methods are all based around the notion of incremental devel
                    opment and delivery, they propose different processes to achieve this. However, they
                    share a set of principles, based on the agile manifesto, and so have much in common.
                    These principles are shown in Figure 3.1. Different agile methods instantiate these prin
                    ciples in different ways and I don’t have space to discuss all agile methods. Instead, I
                    focus on two of the most widely used methods: extreme programming (Section 3.3) and
                    Scrum (Section 3.4).<br><br>
                
                    Agile methods have been very successful for some types of system development:<br><br></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li> Product development where a software company is developing a small or
                             medium-sized product for sale.<br><br></li>
                        <li>Custom system development within an organization, where there is a clear com
                            mitment from the customer to become involved in the development process and
                            where there are not a lot of external rules and regulations that affect the software.<br><br></li>
                    </ol>

                    <hr>

                    <p> As I discuss in the final section of this chapter, the success of agile methods has
                        meant that there is a lot of interest in using these methods for other types of software
                        development. However, because of their focus on small, tightly integrated teams,
                        there are problems in scaling them to large systems. There have also been experi
                        ments in using agile approaches for critical systems engineering (Drobna et al.,
                        2004). However, because of the need for security, safety, and dependability analysis
                        in critical systems, agile methods require significant modification before they can be
                        routinely used for critical systems engineering.<br><br>
                    
                     In practice, the principles underlying agile methods are sometimes difficult to
                     realize:</p>

                     <ol>
                        <li>Although the idea of customer involvement in the development process is an
                            attractive one, its success depends on having a customer who is willing and able
                            to spend time with the development team and who can represent all system
                            stakeholders. Frequently, the customer representatives are subject to other pres
                            sures and cannot take full part in the software development.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Individual team members may not have suitable personalities for the intense
                            involvement that is typical of agile methods, and therefore not interact well with
                            other team members.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Prioritizing changes can be extremely difficult, especially in systems for which
                            there are many stakeholders. Typically, each stakeholder gives different priori
                            ties to different changes.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Maintaining simplicity requires extra work. Under pressure from delivery
                            schedules, the team members may not have time to carry out desirable system
                            simplifications.<br><br></li>
                        <li> Many organizations, especially large companies, have spent years changing
                            their culture so that processes are defined and followed. It is difficult for them to
                            move to a working model in which processes are informal and defined by devel
                            opment teams.<br><br></li>
                     </ol>

                     <p>A key non-technical challenge with agile, incremental development arises when software is
                        built by an external supplier. Traditionally, contracts are based on a fixed set of requirements, 
                        but agile’s evolving specifications make this difficult. Instead, contracts usually pay for developmen
                        t time and effort, not for delivering predefined features. While this can benefit both parties if progress
                        is smooth, disputes may arise if problems occur, leading to disagreements over responsibility and costs.
                        Additionally, most agile literature focuses on new system development, while its use in software maintenance
                        and evolution is less documented, despite maintenance being a major part of software engineering.<br><br>
                        
                        There are two questions that should be considered when considering agile methods and maintenance:<br><br></p>

                        <ol>
                            <li> Are systems that are developed using an agile approach maintainable, given the emphasis in the development 
                                process of minimizing formal documentation?</li>
                            <li> Can agile methods be used effectively for evolving a system in response to customer change requests?</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>Agile methods often minimize formal documentation, arguing it quickly becomes outdated and unreliable. Instead,
                            they emphasize clean, well-structured, and continually improved code as the basis for maintainability. However,
                            the requirements document remains critical for system maintenance, as it explains what the system is meant to 
                            do and helps assess the impact of changes. Since many agile methods capture requirements informally and incrementally, 
                            they may lack a coherent, long-term record of requirements, which can pose challenges during system evolution.<br><br>
                            
                            Agile methods can make future system maintenance harder if requirements are poorly documented. However, applying agile
                            practices during maintenance—such as incremental delivery, designing for change, and keeping systems simple—can be highly
                            effective. In this sense, agile development itself can be seen as a form of continuous software evolution.<br><br>

                            After delivery, maintaining customer involvement becomes difficult, since customers are less likely to dedicate time to ongoing
                            maintenance. Mechanisms like formal change proposals may be needed to capture new requirements. Another challenge is team continuity:
                            agile relies heavily on shared, undocumented knowledge, so breaking up the team can result in significant knowledge loss.<br><br>

                            While advocates often promote agile enthusiastically and critics sometimes overstate its flaws, balanced views suggest that a
                            hybrid approach—combining agile practices with selected plan-driven techniques—may offer the most effective path forward.<br><br></p>

                            <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="title"> 3.2 PLAN-DRIVEN AND AGILE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                            <hr>

                            <p> Agile approaches to software development consider design and implementation to be
                                the central activities in the software process. They incorporate other activities, such as
                                requirements elicitation and testing, into design and implementation. By contrast, a
                                plan-driven approach to software engineering identifies separate stages in the soft
                                ware process with outputs associated with each stage. The outputs from one stage are
                                used as a basis for planning the following process activity. Figure 3.2 shows the dis
                                tinctions between plan-driven and agile approaches to system specification.<br><br>
                            
                                In a plan-driven approach, iteration occurs within activities with formal docu
                                ments used to communicate between stages of the process. For example, the require
                                ments will evolve and, ultimately, a requirements specification will be produced.
                                This is then an input to the design and implementation process. In an agile approach,
                                iteration occurs across activities. Therefore, the requirements and the design are
                                developed together, rather than separately.<br><br>

                                <p> A plan-driven software process can support incremental development and deliv
                                    ery. It is perfectly feasible to allocate requirements and plan the design and develop
                                    ment phase as a series of increments. An agile process is not inevitably code-focused
                                    and it may produce some design documentation. As I discuss in the following sec
                                    tion, the agile development team may decide to include a documentation ‘spike’,
                                    where, instead of producing a new version of a system, the team produce system
                                    documentation.<br><br>
                                
                                 In fact, most software projects include practices from plan-driven and agile
                                    approaches. To decide on the balance between a plan-based and an agile approach,
                                    you have to answer a range of technical, human, and organizational questions:<br><br></p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li> Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to
                                        implementation? If so, you probably need to use a plan-driven approach.<br><br></li>
                                    <li> Is an incremental delivery strategy, where you deliver the software to customers
                                        and get rapid feedback from them, realistic? If so, consider using agile methods.<br><br></li>
                                    <li> How large is the system that is being developed? Agile methods are most effec
                                        tive when the system can be developed with a small co-located team who can
                                        communicate informally. This may not be possible for large systems that require
                                        larger development teams so a plan-driven approach may have to be used.<br><br></li>
                                    <li> What type of system is being developed? Systems that require a lot of analysis
                                        before implementation (e.g., real-time system with complex timing require
                                        ments) usually need a fairly detailed design to carry out this analysis. A plan
                                        driven approach may be best in those circumstances.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>What is the expected system lifetime? Long-lifetime systems may require more
                                        design documentation to communicate the original intentions of the system  developers to the 
                                        support team. However, supporters of agile methods rightly
                                        argue that documentation is frequently not kept up to date and it is not of much
                                        use for long-term system maintenance.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>What technologies are available to support system development? Agile methods
                                        often rely on good tools to keep track of an evolving design. If you are develop
                                        ing a system using an IDE that does not have good tools for program visualiza
                                        tion and analysis, then more design documentation may be required.<br><br></li>
                                    <li> How is the development team organized? If the development team is distributed
                                        or if part of the development is being outsourced, then you may need to develop
                                        design documents to communicate across the development teams. You may
                                        need to plan in advance what these are.<br><br></li>
                                    <li> Are there cultural issues that may affect the system development? Traditional
                                        engineering organizations have a culture of plan-based development, as this is
                                        the norm in engineering. This usually requires extensive design documentation,
                                        rather than the informal knowledge used in agile processes.<br><br></li>
                                    <li> How good are the designers and programmers in the development team? It is
                                        sometimes argued that agile methods require higher skill levels than plan-based
                                        approaches in which programmers simply translate a detailed design into code.
                                        If you have a team with relatively low skill levels, you may need to use the best
                                        people to develop the design, with others responsible for programming.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>Is the system subject to external regulation? If a system has to be approved by an
                                        external regulator (e.g., the Federal Aviation Authority [FAA] approve software
                                        that is critical to the operation of an aircraft) then you will probably be required
                                        to produce detailed documentation as part of the system safety case.<br><br></li>
                                </ol>

                                <p> In reality, the issue of whether a project can be labelled as plan-driven or agile is
                                    not very important. Ultimately, the primary concern of buyers of a software system
                                    is whether or not they have an executable software system that meets their needs and
                                    does useful things for the individual user or the organization. In practice, many com
                                    panies who claim to have used agile methods have adopted some agile practices and
                                    have integrated these with their plan-driven processes.<br><br></p>

                                <p>Extreme programming (XP) is perhaps the best known and most widely used of the
                                    agile methods. The name was coined by Beck (2000) because the approach was
                                    developed by pushing recognized good practice, such as iterative development, to
                                    ‘extreme’ levels. For example, in XP, several new versions of a system may be devel
                                    oped by different programmers, integrated and tested in a day.</p>

                                <p> In extreme programming, requirements are expressed as scenarios (called user
                                    stories), which are implemented directly as a series of tasks. Programmers work in
                                    pairs and develop tests for each task before writing the code. All tests must be suc
                                    cessfully executed when new code is integrated into the system. There is a short time
                                    gap between releases of the system. Figure 3.3 illustrates the XP process to produce
                                    an increment of the system that is being developed.<br><br>
                                
                                 Extreme programming involves a number of practices, summarized in Figure 3.4,
                                 which reflect the principles of agile methods:</p>

                                 <ol>
                                    <li> Incremental development is supported through small, frequent releases of the
                                        system. Requirements are based on simple customer stories or scenarios that are
                                        used as a basis for deciding what functionality should be included in a system
                                        increment.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>Customer involvement is supported through the continuous engagement of the
                                        customer in the development team. The customer representative takes part in the
                                        development and is responsible for defining acceptance tests for the system.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>People, not process, are supported through pair programming, collective owner
                                        ship of the system code, and a sustainable development process that does not
                                        involve excessively long working hours.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>Change is embraced through regular system releases to customers, test-first
                                        development, refactoring to avoid code degeneration, and continuous integra
                                        tion of new functionality.<br><br></li>
                                    <li>Maintaining simplicity is supported by constant refactoring that improves code
                                        quality and by using simple designs that do not unnecessarily anticipate future
                                        changes to the system.<br><br></li>
                                 </ol>

                                 <p> In an XP process, customers are intimately involved in specifying and prioritizing
                                    system requirements. The requirements are not specified as lists of required system
                                    functions. Rather, the system customer is part of the development team and discusses
                                    scenarios with other team members. Together, they develop a ‘story card’ that encap
                                    sulates the customer needs. The development team then aims to implement that sce
                                    nario in a future release of the software. An example of a story card for the mental<br>

                                </p>
                                <hr>

                                <p> health care patient management system is shown in Figure 3.5. This is a short
                                    description of a scenario for prescribing medication for a patient.<br><br>

                                    The story cards are the main inputs to the XP planning process or the ‘planning
                                    game’. Once the story cards have been developed, the development team breaks these
                                    down into tasks (Figure 3.6) and estimates the effort and resources required for imple
                                    menting each task. This usually involves discussions with the customer to refine the
                                    requirements. The customer then prioritizes the stories for implementation, choosing
                                    those stories that can be used immediately to deliver useful business support. The
                                    intention is to identify useful functionality that can be implemented in about two
                                    weeks, when the next release of the system is made available to the customer.<br><br>

                                    Of course, as requirements change, the unimplemented stories change or may be
                                    discarded. If changes are required for a system that has already been delivered, new
                                    story cards are developed and again, the customer decides whether these changes
                                    should have priority over new functionality.</p>

                                    <p> Sometimes, during the planning game, questions that cannot be easily answered
                                        come to light and additional work is required to explore possible solutions. The team
                                        may carry out some prototyping or trial development to understand the problem and
                                        solution. In XP terms, this is a ‘spike’, an increment where no programming is done.
                                        There may also be ‘spikes’ to design the system architecture or to develop system
                                        documentation.<br><br>
                                        Extreme programming takes an ‘extreme’ approach to incremental development.
                                        New versions of the software may be built several times per day and releases are
                                        delivered to customers roughly every two weeks. Release deadlines are never
                                        slipped; if there are development problems, the customer is consulted and function
                                        ality is removed from the planned release.<br><br>
                                        When a programmer builds the system to create a new version, he or she must run
                                        all existing automated tests as well as the tests for the new functionality. The new
                                        build of the software is accepted only if all tests execute successfully. This then
                                        becomes the basis for the next iteration of the system.<br><br>
                                        A fundamental precept of traditional software engineering is that you should
                                        design for change. That is, you should anticipate future changes to the software and
                                        design it so that these changes can be easily implemented.<br><br> Extreme programming,
                                        however, has discarded this principle on the basis that designing for change is often
                                        wasted effort. It isn’t worth taking time to add generality to a program to cope with
                                        change.<br><br> The changes anticipated often never materialize and completely different
                                        change requests may actually be made. Therefore, the XP approach accepts that
                                        changes will happen and reorganize the software when these changes actually occur.

                                        <p> A general problem with incremental development is that it tends to degrade the
                                            software structure, so changes to the software become harder and harder to imple
                                            ment. Essentially, the development proceeds by finding workarounds to problems,
                                            with the result that code is often duplicated, parts of the software are reused in inap
                                            propriate ways, and the overall structure degrades as code is added to the system.<br><br>
                                            Extreme programming tackles this problem by suggesting that the software
                                            should be constantly refactored. This means that the programming team look for
                                            possible improvements to the software and implement them immediately. When a
                                            team member sees code that can be improved, they make these improvements even
                                            in situations where there is no immediate need for them. Examples of refactoring
                                            include the reorganization of a class hierarchy to remove duplicate code, the tidy
                                            ing up and renaming of attributes and methods, and the replacement of code with
                                            calls to methods defined in a program library. Program development environments,
                                            such as Eclipse (Carlson, 2005), include tools for refactoring which simplify the
                                            process of finding dependencies between code sections and making global code
                                            modifications.<br><br>
                                            In principle then, the software should always be easy to understand and change as
                                            new stories are implemented. In practice, this is not always the case. Sometimes
                                            development pressure means that refactoring is delayed because the time is devoted
                                            to the implementation of new functionality. Some new features and changes cannot
                                            readily be accommodated by code-level refactoring and require the architecture of
                                            the system to be modified.<br><br>
                                            In practice, many companies that have adopted XP do not use all of the extreme
                                            programming practices listed in Figure 3.4. They pick and choose according to their
                                            local ways of working. For example, some companies find pair programming help
                                            ful; others prefer to use individual programming and reviews. To accommodate dif
                                            ferent levels of skill, some programmers don’t do refactoring in parts of the system
                                            they did not develop, and conventional requirements may be used rather than user
                                            stories. However, most companies who have adopted an XP variant use small
                                            releases, test-first development, and continuous integration.<br><br></p>

                                            <hr>

                                            <p>As I discussed in the introduction to this chapter, one of the important differences
                                                between incremental development and plan-driven development is in the way that
                                                the system is tested. With incremental development, there is no system specification
                                                that can be used by an external testing team to develop system tests. As a conse
                                                quence, some approaches to incremental development have a very informal testing
                                                process, in comparison with plan-driven testing.<br><br>
                                                To avoid some of the problems of testing and system validation, XP emphasizes
                                                the importance of program testing. XP includes an approach to testing that reduces
                                                the chances of introducing undiscovered errors into the current version of the system.<br><br>
                                               
                                                The key features of testing in XP are:</p>

                                                <ol>
                                                    <li> Test-first development</li>
                                                    <li> incremental test development from scenarios,</li>
                                                    <li> user involvement in the test development and validation, and</li>
                                                    <li> the use of automated testing frameworks.</li>
                                                </ol>

                                                <p> Test-first development is one of the most important innovations in XP. Instead of
                                                    writing some code and then writing tests for that code, you write the tests before you
                                                    write the code. This means that you can run the test as the code is being written and
                                                    discover problems during development.<br><br>
                                                    Writing tests implicitly defines both an interface and a specification of behavior
                                                    for the functionality being developed. Problems of requirements and interface misun
                                                    derstandings are reduced. This approach can be adopted in any process in which there
                                                    is a clear relationship between a system requirement and the code implementing that
                                                    requirement. In XP, you can always see this link because the story cards representing
                                                    the requirements are broken down into tasks and the tasks are the principal unit of
                                                    implementation. The adoption of test-first development in XP has led to more general
                                                    test-driven approaches to development (Astels, 2003). I discuss these in Chapter 8.
                                                    In test-first development, the task implementers have to thoroughly understand
                                                    the specification so that they can write tests for the system. This means that ambigu
                                                    ities and omissions in the specification have to be clarified before implementation
                                                    begins. Furthermore, it also avoids the problem of ‘test-lag’. This may happen when
                                                    the developer of the system works at a faster pace than the tester. The implementa
                                                    tion gets further and further ahead of the testing and there is a tendency to skip tests,
                                                    so that the development schedule can be maintained.<br><br>
                                                    User requirements in XP are expressed as scenarios or stories and the user priori
                                                    tizes these for development. The development team assesses each scenario and
                                                    breaks it down into tasks. For example, some of the task cards developed from the
                                                    story card for prescribing medication (Figure 3.5) are shown in Figure 3.6. Each task
                                                    generates one or more unit tests that check the implementation described in that task.
                                                    Figure 3.7 is a shortened description of a test case that has been developed to check
                                                    that the prescribed dose of a drug does not fall outside known safe limits.<br><br></p>

                                                    <p> The role of the customer in the testing process is to help develop acceptance tests
                                                        for the stories that are to be implemented in the next release of the system. As I dis
                                                        cuss in Chapter 8, acceptance testing is the process where the system is tested using
                                                        customer data to check that it meets the customer’s real needs.<br><br>
                                                    Test-first development and automated testing usually results in a large number of
                                                    tests being written and executed. However, this approach does not necessarily lead to
                                                    thorough program testing. There are three reasons for this:</p>

                                                        <li>Programmers prefer programming to testing and sometimes they take shortcuts
                                                            when writing tests. For example, they may write incomplete tests that do not
                                                            check for all possible exceptions that may occur.<br><br>
                                                            </li>
                                                        <li>Some tests can be very difficult to write incrementally. For example, in a com

                                                        not reviewed and further tests written after development, then undetected bugs may
