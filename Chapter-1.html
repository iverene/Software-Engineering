                        <p class="text-main-white">We can't run the modern world without software. National infrastructures and utilities are
                            controlled by computer-based systems and most electrical products include a computer and controlling software. Industrial manufacturing and distribution is completely
                            computerized, as is the financial system. Entertainment, including the music industry, computer games, and film and television, is software intensive. Therefore,
                            software engineering is essential for the functioning of national and international societies.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white">Software systems are abstract and intangible. They are not constrained by the properties of
                            materials, governed by physical laws, or by manufacturing processes. This simplifies software
                            engineering, as there are no natural limits to the potential of software. However, because of
                            the lack of physical constraints, software systems can quickly become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white"><b>1. Increasing demands</b> As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more
                            complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be built and delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required; systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible. Existing software engineering methods cannot cope and new software engineering techniques have to be developed to meet these new demands.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white"><b>2. Low expectations</b> It is relatively easy to write computer programs without using
                            software engineering methods and techniques. Many companies have drifted into software development as their products and services have evolved. They do not use software engineering methods in their everyday work. Consequently, their software is often more expensive and less reliable than it should be. We need better software engineering education and training to address this problem.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white">Software engineers can be rightly proud of their achievements. Of course we still
                            have problems developing complex software but, without software engineering, we would not have explored space, would not have the Internet or modern telecommunications.
                            All forms of travel would be more dangerous and expensive. Software engineering has contributed
                            a great deal and I am convinced that its contributions in the 21st century will be even greater.</p>

                            However, the vast majority of software development is a professional activity where
                            software is developed for specific business purposes, for inclusion in other devices,
                            or as software products such as information systems, CAD systems, etc. Professional
                            software, intended for use by someone apart from its developer, is usually developed
                            by teams rather than individuals. It is maintained and changed throughout its life.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white"><b>1. Generic products</b> These are stand-alone systems that are produced by a development
                            organization and sold on the open market to any customer who is able to buy them. Examples of this type of product include software for PCs such as databases, word
                            processors, drawing packages, and project-management tools. It also includes so-called vertical applications designed for some specific purpose such as
                            library information systems, accounting systems, or systems for maintaining dental records.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white"><b>2. Customized (or bespoke) products</b> These are systems that are commissioned by
                            a particular customer. A software contractor develops the software especially for that customer. Examples of this type of software include control systems for
                            electronic devices, systems written to support a particular business process, and air traffic control systems.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white">An important difference between these types of software is that, in generic products, the
                            organization that develops the software controls the software specification. For custom products, the specification is usually developed and controlled by the organization
                            that is buying the software. The software developers must work to that specification.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white">However, the distinction between these system product types is becoming increasingly blurred. More and more systems are now being built with a generic
                            product as a base, which is then adapted to suit the requirements of a customer. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, such as the SAP system, are the best
                            examples of this approach. Here, a large and complex system is adapted for a company by incorporating information about business rules and processes, reports required, and so on.</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white">Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of
                            software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the
                            system after it has gone into use. In this definition, there are two key phrases:</p>

                        <p class="text-main-white"><b>1. Engineering discipline</b> Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and
                            tools where these are appropriate. However, they use them selectively and always try to discover solutions to problems even when there are no applicable theories and
                            methods. Engineers also recognize that they must work to organizational and financial constraints so they look for solutions within these constraints.</p>

                            2. All aspects of software production</b> Software engineering is not just concerned
                            with the technical processes of software development. It also includes activities such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to
                            support software production.

                            Engineering is about getting results of the required quality within the schedule and budget.
                            This often involves making compromises—engineers cannot be perfectionists. People writing programs for themselves, however, can spend as much time as they wish on the program development.

                            In general, software engineers adopt a systematic and organized approach to their work, as this is often the most effective way to produce high-quality software.
                            However, engineering is all about selecting the most appropriate method for a set of circumstances so a more creative, less formal approach to development may be
                            effective in some circumstances. Less formal development is particularly appropriate for the development of web-based systems, which requires a blend of software and graphical design skills.

                        <div class="mt-6 space-y-2">
                            <p class="font-semibold text-main-white">Software engineering is important for two reasons:
                                1. More and more, individuals and society rely on advanced software systems. We need to be able
                                to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly.
                                2. It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and techniques
                                for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a personal programming project. For most types of systems, the majority of costs are the costs of
                                changing the software after it has gone into use.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mt-6 space-y-2">
                            <p class="text-main-white">The systematic approach that is used in software engineering is sometimes called a software
                                process. A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the production of a software product. There are four fundamental activities that are common to all
                                software processes. These activities are:
                                1. Software specification, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be
                                produced and the constraints on its operation.
                                2. Software development, where the software is designed and programmed.
                                3. Software validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
                                4. Software evolution, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.
                                </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Different types of systems need different development processes. For example, real-time software in an aircraft has to be completely specified before development
                            begins. In e-commerce systems, the specification and the program are usually developed together. Consequently, these generic activities may be organized in different
                            ways and described at different levels of detail depending on the type of software being developed. I describe software processes in more detail in Chapter 2.</p>

                            <p>Software engineering is a systematic approach to the production of software that takes into
                                account practical cost, schedule, and dependability issues, as well as the needs of software customers and producers. How this systematic approach is actually implemented
                                varies dramatically depending on the organization developing the software, the type of software, and the people involved in the development process.</p>

                                it had little effect on software systems. These systems ran on local computers and were only accessible from within an organization. Around 2000, the Web started to
                                evolve and more and more functionality was added to browsers. This meant that web-based systems could be developed where, instead of a special-purpose user interface, these systems could be accessed using a web browser.</p>

                        <p>Like other engineering disciplines, software engineering is carried out within a social and legal
                            framework that limits the freedom of people working in that area. As a software engineer, you must accept that your job involves wider responsibilities than simply
                            the application of technical skills. You must also behave in an ethical and morally responsible way if you are to be respected as a professional engineer.</p>

                        <p><b>1. Confidentiality</b> You should normally respect the confidentiality of your employers or
                            clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.</p>
                        <p><b>2. Competence</b> You should not misrepresent your level of competence. You should not
                            knowingly accept work that is outside your competence.</p>
                        <p><b>3. Intellectual property rights</b> You should be aware of local laws governing the use of
                            intellectual property such as patents and copyright. You should be careful to ensure that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected.</p>
                        <p><b>4. Computer misuse</b> You should not use your technical skills to misuse other people's
                            computers. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (game playing on an employer's machine, say) to extremely serious (dissemination of viruses or other malware).</p>

                            on the type of systems being produced. I therefore choose an appropriate example when discussing concepts such as safety and dependability, system modeling, reuse, etc.</p>

                            <p><b>1. An embedded system</b> This is a system where the software controls a hardware device and
                                is embedded in that device. Issues in embedded systems typically include physical size, responsiveness, power management, etc. The example of an embedded system
                                that I use is a software system to control a medical device.</p>
                            <p><b>2. An information system</b> This is a system whose primary purpose is to manage and provide
                                access to a database of information. Issues in information systems include security, usability, privacy, and maintaining data integrity. The example of an

                            <p><b>3. A sensor-based data collection system</b> This is a system whose primary purpose is to

                                insulin to diabetic patients. Traditional treatment requires manual measurement of blood sugar and insulin injections, which can lead to risks of dangerously
                                low or high glucose levels. Low glucose can cause brain malfunction, unconsciousness, or death, while prolonged high glucose can damage organs. Advances in
